# race-opt
## Overview
A research framework for autonomous racing focused on optimal control and reinforcement learning.
Built upon and significantly extending ideas from alexliniger/gym-racecar, with modern Gymnasium support, reproducible benchmarking, and real-time telemetry.

## Lineage and Acknowledgements
race-opt is heavily inspired by the pioneering work of Alexander Liniger to the gym-racecar project.

In particular, this repository builds upon:
- The formulation of autonomous racing as an optimal control problem
- The use of spline-based centerline representations

While race-opt is a ground-up re-architecture and not a direct fork, the conceptual foundations established in gym-racecar are essential to this work.
